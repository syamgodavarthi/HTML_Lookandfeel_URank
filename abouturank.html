                The URank(Univeristy Ranking) derives inspiration from College Scorecard project that is designed to increase transparency, putting the power in the hands of
                students and families to compare how well individual postsecondary institutions are preparing their
                students to be successful. This project provides data to help students and families compare college costs
                and outcomes as they weigh the tradeoffs of different colleges, accounting for their own needs and
                educational goals
                <br /><br />
                These data are provided through federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and
                tax information. These data provide insights into the performance of institutions that receive federal
                financial aid dollars, and the outcomes of the students of those institutions. A complete set of these
                data for all active Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) institutions that participate
                in Title IV programs (either by disbursing aid or through deferments) and that are not solely
                administrative offices are available on the Scorecard data webpage and API1. In addition, some
                institutions that do not participate in Title IV programs are also included in the data if they meet similar
                criteria to Title IV participating institutions2
                . A subset of these data elements is displayed on the
                consumer-facing College Scorecard website for undergraduate institutions that are currently operating.
                Note that historical information for non-Title IV institutions (i.e., metrics from 1996-97 through 2016-17)
                is not yet incorporated into the Scorecard data, but inclusion of those data is planned for a future
                release.
                <br /> <br />
                Many data elements are drawn directly from, or derived from, data reported to the IPEDS.
                3 Note that
                some colleges report combined data that pertain to more than one IPEDS institution. The reporting
                institution (called the "parent") also indicates an estimated proportion of the data that applies to each
                of the institutions for which it is reporting (called "child" institutions). In the Scorecard data, these
                proportions are used to allocate data reported by parent institutions to the child institutions to simplify
                both consumer and research use of the data.
